Hi! Iâ€™m a software engineering student passionate about web development.
I enjoy building responsive and engaging web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
Right now, Iâ€™m expanding my knowledge into backend development with Node.js and Express to work towards full-stack expertise.
Iâ€™m a firm believer in continuous learning and collaboration, and Iâ€™m always excited to connect with others in the tech community. 
Youâ€™ll find some of my projects here as I explore new skills and techniques. 
Letâ€™s build something great togetherâ€”feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate! ðŸ˜Š
